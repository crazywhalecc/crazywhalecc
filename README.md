### What?

I want to change a new avatar.

My name **crazywhalecc** is originally from my self-hosted Minecraft server ID, my Chinese name sounds more like "é²¸é±¼", English is "Whale". So my ID is crazywhale, my English name is Jerry (sounds like my first name). cc is ChallengeCollapsar, or just meaningless.
