### crazywhalecc

My name is Jerry Ma.

PHP programmer, web security issue creator, CrazyBot(zhamao) Team maintainer.

Playing Command & Conquer Red Alert 2, Minecraft.

And I won't exclude any other languages from contacting me, ä¸­æ–‡, English, etc. ðŸ˜ƒ

I do something unrelated to the coding.

Good at making wheels, writing some useless scripts and crashing my own computers and servers.

Be stronger!
